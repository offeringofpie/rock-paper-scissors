## Background information

Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock is an expansion of the classic game of rock-paper-scissors. In addition to the three original choices, there are two new options: lizard and Spock. This simulates an ultimate battle between many players. This game mode was created by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla ([official website](http://www.samkass.com/theories/RPSSL.html)).

As [Sheldon explains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kov2G0GouBw&t=38s) in the TV series Big Bang Theory, **"Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."**
